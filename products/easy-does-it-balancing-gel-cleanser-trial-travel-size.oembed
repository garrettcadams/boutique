Often times, our best efforts at clear pores clear out our skin’s natural defenses, too. With a unique combination of organic Chilean soap bark, cold-pressed apple oil and vegetable glycerin, Easy Does It lathers into a soothing, non-drying foam that cleans, softens and helps to protect face, body and hair. That’s right. Turns out those 17 different soaps and shampoos aren’t necessary after all.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSIZE: \u003c\/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2.25 oz.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Beauty Notes\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/em\u003e: \u003cstrong\u003eEffective, gentle, non-drying (and non-toxic) cleansers that foam, or suds-up, are hard to come by, which is one of many reasons we can’t seem to put this down. The glycerin is an organic compound that works to address everything from acne scars, blackheads and large pores to hydration and signs of aging.  When married with the Chilean soap bark and cold-pressed apple oil this works to balance your skins pH. Pairs perfectly with One Love Organics Cleansing Heart Sponge to clean deeper, tackle unique face crevices and to ensure makeup removal. OUR TIP: Can also be used as a family shampoo and body wash thanks to its gentle nature. \u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003eDirections\u003c\/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMassage onto damp skin using gentle, circular motions.
