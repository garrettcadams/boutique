This game-changing oil provides an all-in-one approach for hydration and (in true Kjaer Weis form) better makeup by its premise to create a glowing, hydrated skin perfectly primed for makeup application - and just as beautifully for those who prefer a 'no makeup look'. This will create a glow nothing short of perfection. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo use\u003c\/em\u003e: Warm up 5 or 6 generous drops of Beautiful Oil on the back of your hand. Apply morning or night to face, neck and décollété, being careful not to get oil into eyes. When using under Kjaer Weis Foundation or Cream Blush, wait 3-4 minutes for oil to absorb into skin before applying makeup. Store at room temperature, out of direct sunlight.

Dioscorea Batatas: A bright white root with small white flowers and a subtle fragrance of cinnamon, it’s been called “The Root of Light”. For thousands of years, traditional medicinal practices have harnessed the vitality of this root to protect from environmental stresses and elevate energy and spirit. In the early 20th century, philosopher Rudolf Steiner explored the functions of this powerful root and believed the tubers stored a high amount of etheric light transferrable to humans, supporting both physical and spiritual health. Grown in biodynamic fields that have been additive-free for 15 years, the Kjaer Weis factory in Italy spent years developing a special harvesting method for the root, created to retain the powerful energetic qualities of this special plant.\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"fusion-title title\"\u003e\n\u003ch3 class=\"title-heading-left\"\u003e\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: #000000; font-family: 'Playfair Display', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; background-color: #f9f9f9;\"\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/em\u003e\u003c\/h5\u003e","brand":"Kjaer Weis","offers":[{"title":"Beautiful Oil","offer_id":30150241105,"sku":"","price":225.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Refill Only","offer_id":31118599313,"sku":"","price":190.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0731\/0835\/products\/KjaerWeisBeautifulOilBottle_copy.jpg?v=1487892805","url":"https:\/\/levertbeauty.com\/products\/the-beautiful-oil","provider":"LeVert Beauty","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
